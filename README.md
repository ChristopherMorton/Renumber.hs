Short version:

Go to a directory where the files have an ordering tag at the start, e.g.:

01.first
02.second
04.third
08.fourth

Then run renumber with one argument that says where to start counting from, like:

renumber 143

And the result is the files will be retagged in order, starting with that number, as so:

0143.first
0144.second
0145.third
0146.fourth

What is this useful for? Well, I've used it to order a bunch of music files from different CDs in a multi-CD audiobook. That's... that's really the only use I can think of right now. Still.
